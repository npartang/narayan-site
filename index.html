        <h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I am a dynamic and visionary technology executive with a proven record of scaling global engineering teams
  and delivering secure, high-performance platforms to transform business outcomes. Expert at aligning
  people, platforms, and strategy to accelerate innovation, elevate customer experience, and drive
  measurable growth. Recognized for building exceptional leadership teams, leading large-scale agile
  and cloud transformations, and executing modernization initiatives across complex enterprise
  ecosystems. Passionate about leveraging technology to simplify complexity, empower teams, and create
  lasting competitive advantages.
</p>

<p>
  I currently serve as <strong>Senior Managing Director of Software Engineering</strong> at
  <strong>OneMain Financial</strong>, reporting to the CTO and leading enterprise-wide software delivery
  across the personal loans platform, including acquisitions, servicing, customer communications,
  payments, document management, CIAM, and shared services. My role centers on driving multi-year
  digital modernization initiatives, including unifying personal loans and wellness products into a
  single app experience, modernizing legacy platforms from Ruby on Rails to Angular and domain-driven
  microservices, and establishing a centralized UI Platform organization. In parallel, I have led the
  evolution of OneMain’s customer communications platform to support personalized, compliant
  omnichannel engagement and am currently driving a large-scale document management modernization to
  replace fragmented legacy systems with a secure, scalable platform supporting tens of millions of
  documents monthly and thousands of users.
</p>

<p>
  Equally important to me is building strong leadership teams and a sustainable engineering culture.
  I have scaled organizations to several hundred engineers, developed and mentored senior leaders
  across multiple domains, embedded agile and product-led delivery models, and established
  metrics-driven operating rigor focused on quality, predictability, and continuous improvement.
  In parallel, I am actively leading the adoption of GenAI and agentic AI across engineering and
  customer-facing domains, applying these capabilities to improve engineering productivity,
  accelerate delivery, enhance decision-making, and enable more contextual, personalized customer
  experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I led global engineering at <strong>ScienceLogic</strong> as Vice President of Engineering,
  overseeing a 200+ person organization and modernizing an enterprise AIOps platform recognized by
  Forrester and EMA. Earlier roles span enterprise SaaS, AI/ML platforms, cloud infrastructure, and
  large-scale distributed systems.
</p>

<p>
  I would welcome the opportunity to connect and share more context on my background, as well as
  learn about any current or upcoming senior engineering or technology leadership searches where my
  experience may be a fit. I appreciate your discretion and look forward to the possibility of
  speaking.

          This site includes a conversational assistant that can answer questions about my background,
          experience, and work. Think of it as “chatting with Narayan” before we actually meet.
